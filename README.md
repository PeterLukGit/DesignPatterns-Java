Design Patterns for Java
===================
Design Patterns are solutions to common software design problems that occur over and over in 
software development.

>'''
Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment , and then describes the core of
the solution to that problem , in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing 
it the same way twice
